# critical_nets_riemannian_manifolds
Construction of critical nets in 2D and 3D euclidean spaces

Once the Code.zip file is extracted, you may run one or more of the example scripts: Script_example_2D.m, Script_example_3D.m, Script_experiment.m. 

Script_example_2D.m is a demonstration of how to construct a critical net in 2D, whereas Script_example_3D.m demonstrates how to construct a critical net in 3D. Script_experiment.m is a demonstration of how to perform the experiment with fine-tuning the ratio.
